# Macro-Calc

Single project that handles a calculator made with Rust. I made this repo public cuz why not lmao. I use cargo to build the project (as a normal Rust dev). This project is actually made to learn Rust in a nutshell. 

## Local 
If you are an obsessive like me, you can clone this project and test it by yourself. Remember you should have [cargo](https://crates.io/) installed 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Its-Yayo/Macro-Calc.git
$ cd Macro-Calc
```

You can actually update any changes too!
```bash
$ git pull
```

## Build
You need to build this project first
```bash
$ cargo build
```

Then u now can run it
```bash
$ cargo run
```


# License
Obviously I didn't add a license for this project since it's only for me :))
